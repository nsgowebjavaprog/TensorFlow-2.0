    "#### 1. **TF Hub – Pre-trained Models**\n",
    "\n",
    "**TensorFlow Hub** is a library that enables the easy reuse of pre-trained machine learning models. You can use these models directly for transfer learning, which helps to reduce the amount of data and training time required.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Usage**: You can import pre-trained models from TF Hub and use them for tasks such as image classification, text embeddings, and more.\n",

    "model_url = \"https://tfhub.dev/google/imagenet/mobilenet_v2_140_224/feature_vector/4\"\n",
    "feature_extractor = hub.KerasLayer(model_url, input_shape=(224, 224, 3))\n",
    "\n",
    "# Build a model using the feature extractor\n",
    "model = tf.keras.Sequential([\n",
    "    feature_extractor,\n",
    "    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')\n",
