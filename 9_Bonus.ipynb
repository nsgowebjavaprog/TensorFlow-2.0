    "### ðŸ“Œ **Bonus: Real-World Skills for 30â€“40 LPA**\n",
    "\n",
    "To excel in high-paying roles (30â€“40 LPA), particularly in AI, Machine Learning, and Agentic Systems, you need to possess a blend of deep technical knowledge, hands-on experience, and a strong ability to build and deploy sophisticated models. Below, we break down the key real-world skills you should master, including how to leverage tools like TensorFlow and advanced machine learning architectures to meet industry demands.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Agentic Systems (LLM + TF): Chaining Tools, Memory, Reasoning**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Agentic Systems** refer to AI models that possess some form of \"agency,\" meaning they can take actions based on learned knowledge, interact with external environments, and solve problems autonomously. These systems are commonly seen in the integration of **Large Language Models (LLM)** with reinforcement learning, memory components, and reasoning processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Chaining Tools**: In an agentic system, you can chain multiple AI models or tools together to achieve a more complex goal. For example, using an LLM (like GPT) to generate text, a tool to search the web, and another tool to make decisions based on the gathered information.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Memory**: Memory in agentic systems refers to the ability to retain and recall past interactions to improve decision-making over time. This is especially useful in tasks like dialogue systems where the agent needs to remember previous conversations to provide coherent responses.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Reasoning**: Agentic systems can also reason about the state of the world and infer the next best action, often using decision-making algorithms or search strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Code Example** (Agentic System with LLM + TF for chaining and reasoning):\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example: Chain LLM with TF for decision making\n",
    "import tensorflow as tf\n",
    "import openai  # Assume using GPT-3 for LLM\n",
    "\n",
    "# Simple function to get a decision from the LLM\n",
    "def get_action_from_llm(query):\n",
    "    response = openai.Completion.create(\n",
    "        engine=\"text-davinci-003\", \n",
    "        prompt=query,\n",
    "        max_tokens=50\n",
    "    )\n",
    "    return response.choices[0].text.strip()\n",

    "# Using TensorFlow model to evaluate the LLM output\n",
    "def evaluate_action_with_tf(action):\n",
    "    # Simple example: Use a TF model to evaluate the LLM-generated action\n",
    "    model = tf.keras.Sequential([\n",
    "        tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid', input_shape=(10,))\n",
    "    ])\n",
    "    action_score = model.predict(tf.random.normal([1, 10]))  # Simulate evaluation\n",
    "    return action_score\n",

    "action_evaluation = evaluate_action_with_tf(action)\n",
    "print(f\"Action: {action}, Evaluation: {action_evaluation}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation**:\n",
    "- **Chaining** involves using the LLM to generate an action based on a query and then evaluating it using TensorFlow.\n",
    "- **Memory** is simply storing past actions and decisions, and **Reasoning** involves evaluating these decisions based on the learned knowledge from the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interview Q&A**:\n",
    "1. **What is an agentic system and how does it work?**\n",
    "   - An agentic system combines LLMs with reinforcement learning, reasoning, and memory to perform tasks autonomously. These systems learn from their environment, make decisions, and store memories to improve future interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **How can TensorFlow be used in agentic systems?**\n",
    "   - TensorFlow can be used to evaluate the decisions made by the LLM and refine the systemâ€™s reasoning capabilities by training models that assess the outcomes of certain actions.\n",

    "#### 2. **Hybrid ML Systems (Classical + Deep Learning)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hybrid ML Systems** combine classical machine learning techniques (like decision trees, SVMs, or random forests) with deep learning models (like CNNs, RNNs, or transformers) to leverage the best of both worlds.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Classical ML** is often more interpretable and requires less data.\n",

    "# For simplicity, we use random data\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "X = np.random.rand(100, 10)  # Classical feature data\n",
    "y = np.random.randint(0, 2, 100)  # Labels\n",
    "\n",
    "# Split the data\n",
    "X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)\n",

    "# Evaluate\n",
    "print(\"Hybrid Model Accuracy:\", accuracy_score(y_test, final_predictions))\n",
    "```\n",

    "- The **RandomForestClassifier** is used for classical machine learning, and a **Simple Neural Network (NN)** is employed for deep learning.\n",
    "- The final predictions are a weighted combination of both models to leverage the strengths of each.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interview Q&A**:\n",
    "1. **What are hybrid machine learning systems?**\n",
    "   - Hybrid systems combine traditional machine learning techniques with deep learning models. They allow you to tackle both simple and complex problems by using the appropriate approach for each.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Why would you use a hybrid approach in real-world systems?**\n",
    "   - Hybrid systems enable you to balance the interpretability and simplicity of classical ML with the powerful feature extraction capabilities of deep learning, leading to more efficient and scalable models.\n",

    "#### 3. **Model Monitoring Post-Deployment (TensorFlow + Prometheus/Logs)**\n",
    "\n",
    "After deploying a model in production, it's crucial to monitor its performance to ensure it works as expected over time. **TensorFlow** can be integrated with monitoring tools like **Prometheus** and **Logs** for this purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Prometheus**: A system for collecting and querying metrics, often used for monitoring the performance of applications and systems.\n",
    "- **Logs**: Logs provide detailed records of system operations, including model predictions, errors, and more.\n",

    "prediction_metric = prometheus_client.Counter('model_predictions', 'Number of predictions made')\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.route('/predict', methods=['POST'])\n",
    "def predict():\n",
    "    input_data = request.get_json()\n",
    "    prediction = model.predict(input_data)  # Assuming model is already loaded\n",
    "    prediction_metric.inc()  # Increment prediction count\n",
    "    return jsonify({'prediction': prediction.tolist()})\n",
    "\n",
    "# Start Prometheus metrics server\n",
    "from prometheus_client import start_http_server\n",
    "start_http_server(8000)  # Metrics accessible on port 8000\n",
    "\n",
    "# Start Flask app\n",
    "app.run(debug=True)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation**:\n",
    "- **Prometheus** tracks the number of predictions made by the model, and this data can be queried to monitor the modelâ€™s activity.\n",
    "- **Flask** is used to serve the model and expose prediction functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interview Q&A**:\n",
    "1. **Why is model monitoring important in production?**\n",
    "   - Model monitoring helps ensure the model continues to perform correctly after deployment. It allows you to detect performance degradation, handle failures, and take corrective action when necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **How do you integrate TensorFlow with Prometheus for monitoring?**\n",
    "   - By exposing metrics like the number of predictions or model latency through Flask and Prometheus, you can track the model's behavior in real-time and ensure it performs as expected in production.\n",
